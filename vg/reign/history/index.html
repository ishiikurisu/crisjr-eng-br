                # Reign Timeline

                Written history begin in Roga with the Këble people and their language. They lived in the region between Roga and Horagawa and developed the first written system. They wrote about the Kiten people, living where Minas is today; and the Orisha people. These 3 communities traded amongst themselves: the Orisha people were skilled miners; the Kiten ones, farmers; and the Këble ones, crafters. They were the only communities at the time that identified themselves as nations. Other communities that existed back then but didn't have the nation feeling were the Kyoukai, the Roga, and the Gaia.

                Important thing: all tribes and nations follow a collectivist social system, so no rulers or leaders, just the sense of family. Of course, each nation has its own peculiarities regarding that, but that is the general idea. It is theorized that this idea was brought by the Orisha people and, alonside the script invention, were the key elements that consisted the overall culture of the Reign continent.

                ### Particularities of each starting culture

                Orisha is the birthplace of its religion <!-- TODO  give Orisha religion a name -->, and since then, it has been followed on Orisha, Kyoukai, and Gaia. The Kyoukai region, surrounded by mountains and a large forest, was considered sacred by the Orisha people and they built several statues of their representation of God. Some of them can still be seen today.

                Orisha uses a consensus-based decision making govt system, while Këble followed a majority based one, and Kiten followed a suggestion based one (the most experienced members of the community would give suggestions to the others on how to identify and solve problems).

                #### Kinds of government

                "Consensus government" means those who are interested in the problems gather and propose solutions. The selected solution is the one **everybody** interested agrees upon.

                "Majority government" is like consensus but the picked solution is the one the **majority** agress upon.


                ## Expansion period

                Under the influence of an ambitious king <!-- TODO give this guy a name -->, the Këble community decided to expand its territories and become stronger. They took over Roga and Gaia. There already were people there by the way, and these people now had to follow Këble's culture:

                - force communities to speak Këble -- curiously, Gaia didn't follow this rule
                - force communities to trade with Këble

                Following a similar idea, the Orisha nation also started to expand as to protect their lifestyle. They took over Kyoukai and Kiten. They also discovered Minami, a island by the south that was rich in ores. These ores were proven to be useful as clashes between the Orisha and the Këble began to grow. Changes made by the Orisha nation during the expansion period include:

                - reorganize the kiten people as the Horagawa community (named after a basin surrounded by a river of same name, named after a ravine near Minas), now centered in Pium instead of Minas so they could work in the mines closer to Orisha.
                - force nations to speak Orisha's language -- in Horagawa, this basically only worked in Pium, as Minas people still spoke the Kiten language but absorbed Orisha's alphabet.

                As these two empires were growing larger, they eventually confronted each other to see who would "control the world", thus triggering the **Expansion Wars**. During these wars, many of the citizens from Këble ran away from their country and moved to the Feröo island. The "good willed" people founded the Feröo nation. These people spoke a "vulgar" variant of the Këble language, which has evolved to become a language on its own.

                In the end, Orisha was able to come the Këble nation to its knees, and their capital was destroyed. However, Orisha had no way of taking care of all tribes under Këble, so these became a nation on its own called Banderanto, which compromised of today's Gaia and Roga and was centered in Parokjo.


                ## Separation period

                Some years of prosperity came after the expansion wars: both Orisha and Banderanto were mining power houses, with Orisha being led by Minami's engineers and Banderanto, by Gaia's explorers. This led to a few separatist movements that would eventually take over the whole continent.

                ### Independence Uprising

                At some point, Minami's economy started to surpass Orisha's one. With the discovery of gold, Minami was held as the most powerful community in the continent thanks to its natural resources and research efforts. Minami even started to expand upon its original region and occupied a few islands in the north of the mushroom island and tried to occupy a few islands in the south sea. This led to a popular consensus to get Minami independent from Orisha. Orisha had no choice but to leave Minami take its own course. This meant Minami got to keep its ore, which in turn meant Orisha now had to mine somewhere else.

                Orisha changed its focus to the Horagawa region, as it was full of mines and precious ore. The Horagawa people got mad at this move and started to rebel. Eventually, they forced the Orisha out of Horagawa and even occupied Kyoukai. However, they left the Kyoukai on their own because they didn't see anything worth there. Thus the Horagawa nation also became independent. It should be noted that they kept most of the structures left by the Orisha, such as their language and Pium as the center of the nation.

                ### Separation wars

                Meanwhile, the tension in Banderanto was growing. The Gaia and the Roga people were too different to remain as only one nation since Gaia followed the Orisha religion and spoke its own language, while the Roga were basically a new version of the Këble. The only thing that kept the two communities together was the Japi valley, which contained most the ore that fed the nation. Eventually, the two communities fought a war to take over the valley. No winner was declared as both nations almost disappeared but they agreed to become independent from each other.


                ## Current times

                Minami and Orisha have actually grown a lot together, as both nations respect each other and want to keep their lifestyle.

                After the separation uprising, the Orisha and the Horagawa were in good terms, as they understood they still need each other to thrive (Orisha still has expertise in mining but they have nowhere to mine, while the Horagawa don't know how to mine but they have plenty of natural resources). They also speak the same language to some extent, which makes the trading between the two nations easier.

                Horagawa and Minami are on really good terms, as both are old Orisha colonies, also share the same language at some extent. However, it mostly consists of Minami "stealing" from Horagawa as Minami knows it is stronger than Horagawa.

                Horagawa and Gaia are able to trade as their languages share a common root but they don't it very often since they nations in similar situations and can't offer a lot to each other.

                Both Gaia and Roga use the Japi valley now but there has been an effort from the Roga to use the resources within their own land to survive. Gaia and Roga are not on good terms and despite being able to communicate, they don't trade.

                Roga and Horagawa are in good terms

                Roga is able to communicate with Feröo but still need to make a lot of effort so they can trade properly. Feröo lack a lot of know-how to craft anything that is worth trading though.

                Feröo and Horagawa are not able to communicate thus they can't trade. In fact, Horagawa has this prejudice against Feröa people that prevents the Horagawans from creating bounds with them.
